# Raycast-Maze

## Overview

This is a randomly generated 3D maze rendered by raycasting a scene and dropping the results into a 2D canvas.

It has some basic sound, ditance-fading, and a few various types of textures.

I built this as a proof of concept for a presentation I was giving about game development in javascript.

I won't likely be updating this repo, sp feel free to copy, fork, or reuse whatever you like from this.
